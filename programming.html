                        <p>Programming allows us to not only create applications and games but allows us to create machines that assist us in preforming complex tasks. And we can use our programming knowledge to upgrade machines and applications in order
                            to work more efficiently.</p>

                        <p>Programming is an important skill in the industry as it allows us to carry out repetitive tasks via the use of a machine. Complex or repetitive calculations take time to compute when done by hand, but we with the use of electronics
                            and computers, we can simplify our tasks and focus manpower elsewhere. While computers are great for logical operations, they do not work well particularly for "creative" tasks, such as inventing new ideas and creating images
                            from scratch. However, this is changing as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is closing the gap between what humans and machines can do. Deep learning allows computers to become more "creative" and "human-like". AI will be the next
                            important innovation in Computer Science that will have a significant impact on computers as we know them, further reinforcing the need for Computer Scientists in the industry.
